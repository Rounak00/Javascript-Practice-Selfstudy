document.addEventListener('click', funcrion(){ console.log("this is anonymous function")})// here function has no name its a anonymous functio0n


let sum=function(a,b){console.log(a+b); }// this is a anonymous function

# Functions those dont have name are anonymous function, Doesn't have its own identity, so if you make a anonymous function it will be a syntax error

Anonymous functions mainly use where functions act like values
